# !exit
A little game I made in JavaScript using the p5.js library. It borrows some code and inspiration\
from videos on ray casting by Daniel Shiffman (coding train #145 and #146).

Use 'W' to move, 'P' to pause (and edit FOV, resolution and brightness), hold 'SPACE' to run and\
use the mouse to look around. Play by going to:

Enjoy, and let me know if you make it out of the maze!
