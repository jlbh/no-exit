# !exit
A little game I made in JavaScript using the p5.js library. It borrows some code and \
inspiration from videos on ray casting by Daniel Shiffman (coding train #145 and #146).

Use the mouse to look around and move, 'P' to pause (and edit FOV, resolution and brightness).

Enjoy, and let me know if you make it out of the labyrinth!
