# !exit
A little game I made in JavaScript using the p5.js library. It borrows some code and inspiration\
from videos on ray casting by Daniel Shiffman (coding train #145 and #146).

Use 'W' to move, 'P' to pause (and edit FOV, resolution and brightness), hold 'SPACE' to run and\
use the mouse to look around.

Enjoy, and let me know if you make it out of the maze!
